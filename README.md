# Python-Guessing-Game-Program

This is a simple guessing game I made in Python.

This program is a simple game that makes a user guess a number between a given range depending on the difficulty that the user chose. 

The program only validates integers and does not have an exit menu once it begins.

The program difficulty options are:
- 1 for easy: Guess number between 1 - 50
- 2 for medium: Guess number between 1 - 100
- 3 for hard: Guess number between 1 - 200

The program has two ways of helping the user find the correct number:
- If the guess inputted by the user is lesser than the hidden number, then the program will print a hint to the user (Try a higher number)
- If the guess inputted by the user is higher than the hidden number, then the program will print a hint to the user (Try a lower number)

Once the user correctly guesses the number, the program will output the number of attempts made to guess the correct answer and print out a "Well Done!" string to congratulate the user.
